TestApp
=======

Instead of having scattered throw-away projects all over the place with various implemenation techniques and little tips and tricks, I'm adding all to this project so I end up with a nice collection.

* TilingScrollView: an "infinite" scrollview using CATiledLayer iOS Recipes, Recipe 11
* MultiTouch: drag and rotation gesture recognizers WWDC Videos 2010 Session 120
* TableView: UITableView with custom static background image and custom cells http://www.raywenderlich.com/2033/core-graphics-101-lines-rectangles-and-gradients
* CoreGraphics: CG doodles as I follow along WWDC 2011 Session 129
* LazyTable: table view that lazily loads images using NSURLConnection sendAsynchronousRequest:queue:completionHandler
* Fonts: list of all available fonts
* EventKit: lists all events -1 day until +1 day from now
* PullToRefresh: UITableViewController with pull to refresh (https://github.com/leah/PullToRefresh)
* SwipeCell: Cell that can be swiped to reveal a 2nd view behind it
