Instead of having scattered throw-away projects all over the place with various implemenation techniques and little tips and tricks, I'm adding all to this project so I end up with a nice collection.

* TilingScrollView: an "infinite" scrollview using CATiledLayer iOS Recipes, Recipe 11
* MultiTouch: drag and rotation gesture recognizers WWDC Videos 2010 Session 120
* TableView: UITableView with custom static background image and custom cells http://www.raywenderlich.com/2033/core-graphics-101-lines-rectangles-and-gradients
